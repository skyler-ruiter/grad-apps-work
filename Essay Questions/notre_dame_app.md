## Statement of Intent

The statement of intent should capture your intellectual development and interests. It should generally be 1–3 double-spaced pages in length. Once you have drafted your statement, ask a few faculty members to review it. A trip to your institution’s writing center is also beneficial as you work to polish the finished product. This is your opportunity to present a strong argument about why you would be an excellent student in the program, so be sure that you are completely satisfied with the document you submit.

* Establish your desire for the degree and how you envision using your training and knowledge in the future.

* Articulate why you have selected your specific program, i.e.. how your interest coincides with those of the faculty.

* Identify the strengths that you would bring to the program (e.g., credentials, experience).

* Explain any unusual situations but refrain from providing excuses.

* Be sure to include your name and prospective program on each page of the statement—even though you submit the document electronically.

## Force for Good Statement

The University of Notre Dame wants to educate and inspire its students to be moral citizens within their communities and the larger world, to use their talents to the best of their ability, and to develop the generous sensibilities needed to relieve injustice, oppression, and poverty in all of their manifestations. In sum, our vision is for students to be a 'force for good" in their distinctive communities. We know that our students' lived experiences will be broad--from a wide range of backgrounds--and the communities they impact will vary. Discuss how your individual background and lived experience have shaped your educational journey so far, and how you hope it may contribute to your future impact on society or your community.
