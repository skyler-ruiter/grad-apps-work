# Wisconsin Madison Application

## Personal Statement

The statement is your opportunity to tell us about your goals in pursuing graduate studies and about your specific interest areas. It helps us to understand the mix of interests in our pool of applicants and to learn more about your preparation for graduate work. Avoid overly enthusiastic, very general statements that give us little insight into your accomplishments or motivation. A concise statement about your experience and future goals that is backed by other elements of the application is most effective.
